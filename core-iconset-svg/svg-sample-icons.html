The `core-icon` element displays an icon. By default an icon renders as 24px square.

Example using src:

    <core-icon src="star.png"></core-icon>

Example setting size to 32px x 32px:

    <core-icon class="big" src="big_star.png"></core-icon>

    <style>
      .big {
        height: 32px;
        width: 32px;
      }
    </style>

Example using icon from default iconset:

    <core-icon icon="menu"></core-icon>

Example using icon `cherry` from custom iconset `fruit`:

    <core-icon icon="fruit:cherry"></core-icon>

See [core-iconset](#core-iconset) and [core-iconset-svg](#core-iconset-svg) for more information about
how to use a custom iconset.

See [core-icons](http://www.polymer-project.org/components/core-icons/demo.html) for the default set of icons. To use the default set of icons you'll need to include an import for `core-icons.html`. To use a different built-in set of icons, you'll need to include an import for `core-icons/iconsets/<iconset>.html`.

/**
 * @group Polymer Core Elements
 *
 * The `core-iconset` element allows users to define their own icon sets. 
 * The `src` property specifies the url of the icon image. Multiple icons may
 * be included in this image and they may be organized into rows.
 * The `icons` property is a space separated list of names corresponding to the
 * icons. The names must be ordered as the icons are ordered in the icon image.
 * Icons are expected to be square and are the size specified by the `iconSize`
 * property. The `width` property corresponds to the width of the icon image 
 * and must be specified if icons are arranged into multiple rows in the image.
 *
 * All `core-iconset` elements are available for use by other `core-iconset`
 * elements via a database keyed by id. Typically, an element author that wants
 * to support a set of custom icons uses a `core-iconset` to retrieve 
 * and use another, user-defined iconset.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *     <core-iconset id="my-icons" src="my-icons.png" width="96" iconSize="24"
 *         icons="location place starta stopb bus car train walk">
 *     </core-iconset>
 *
 * This will automatically register the icon set "my-icons" to the iconset
 * database.  To use these icons from within another element, make a 
 * `core-iconset` element and call the `byId` method to retrieve a
 * given iconset. To apply a particular icon to an element, use the 
 * `applyIcon` method. For example:
 *
 *     iconset.applyIcon(iconNode, 'car');
 *
 * Themed icon sets are also supported. The `core-iconset` can contain child
 * `property` elements that specify a theme with an offsetX and offsetY of the
 * theme within the icon resource. For example.
 *
 *     <core-iconset id="my-icons" src="my-icons.png" width="96" iconSize="24"
 *         icons="location place starta stopb bus car train walk">
 *       <property theme="special" offsetX="256" offsetY="24"></property>
 *     </core-iconset>
 *
 * Then a themed icon can be applied like this:
 *
 *     iconset.applyIcon(iconNode, 'car', 'special');
 *
 * @element core-iconset
 * @extends core-meta
 * @homepage github.io

`core-meta` provides a method of constructing a self-organizing database.
It is useful to collate element meta-data for things like catalogs and for 
designer.

Example, an element folder has a `metadata.html` file in it, that contains a 
`core-meta`, something like this:

    <core-meta id="my-element" label="My Element">
      <property name="color" value="blue"></property>
    </core-meta>

An application can import as many of these files as it wants, and then use 
`core-meta` again to access the collected data.

    <script>
      var meta = document.createElement('core-meta');
      console.log(meta.list); // dump a list of all meta-data elements that have been created
    </script>

Use `byId(id)` to retrive a specific core-meta.

    <script>
      var meta = document.createElement('core-meta');
      console.log(meta.byId('my-element'));
    </script>

By default all meta-data are stored in a single databse.  If your meta-data 
have different types and want them to be stored separately, use `type` to 
differentiate them.

Example:

    <core-meta id="x-foo" type="xElt"></core-meta>
    <core-meta id="x-bar" type="xElt"></core-meta>
    <core-meta id="y-bar" type="yElt"></core-meta>

    <script>
      var meta = document.createElement('core-meta');
      meta.type = 'xElt';
      console.log(meta.list);
    </script>

 * The `core-iconset-svg` element allows users to define their own icon sets
 * that contain svg icons. The svg icon elements should be children of the
 * `core-iconset-svg` element. Multiple icons should be given distinct id's.
 *
 * Using svg elements to create icons has a few advantages over traditional
 * bitmap graphics like jpg or png. Icons that use svg are vector based so they
 * are resolution independent and should look good on any device. They are
 * stylable via css. Icons can be themed, colorized, and even animated.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *     <core-iconset-svg id="my-svg-icons" iconSize="24">
 *       <svg>
 *         <defs>
 *           <g id="shape">
 *             <rect x="50" y="50" width="50" height="50" />
 *             <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="50" />
 *           </g>
 *         </defs>
 *       </svg>
 *     </core-iconset-svg>
 *
 * This will automatically register the icon set "my-svg-icons" to the iconset
 * database.  To use these icons from within another element, make a
 * `core-iconset` element and call the `byId` method
 * to retrieve a given iconset. To apply a particular icon inside an
 * element use the `applyIcon` method. For example:
 *
 *     iconset.applyIcon(iconNode, 'car');

`core-meta` provides a method of constructing a self-organizing database.
It is useful to collate element meta-data for things like catalogs and for 
designer.

Example, an element folder has a `metadata.html` file in it, that contains a 
`core-meta`, something like this:

    <core-meta id="my-element" label="My Element">
      <property name="color" value="blue"></property>
    </core-meta>

An application can import as many of these files as it wants, and then use 
`core-meta` again to access the collected data.

    <script>
      var meta = document.createElement('core-meta');
      console.log(meta.list); // dump a list of all meta-data elements that have been created
    </script>

Use `byId(id)` to retrive a specific core-meta.

    <script>
      var meta = document.createElement('core-meta');
      console.log(meta.byId('my-element'));
    </script>

By default all meta-data are stored in a single databse.  If your meta-data 
have different types and want them to be stored separately, use `type` to 
differentiate them.

Example:

    <core-meta id="x-foo" type="xElt"></core-meta>
    <core-meta id="x-bar" type="xElt"></core-meta>
    <core-meta id="y-bar" type="yElt"></core-meta>

    <script>
      var meta = document.createElement('core-meta');
      meta.type = 'xElt';
      console.log(meta.list);
    </script>
